This project is mainly to practice the separation of concerns between game logic and dom logic so that way everything is not in one js file.
There are likely some improvements that could be made but the S.O.L.I.D design principles were kept in mind during my creation of this small web game

This is left in a working mode for one player only with a computer. 
Only a few modifications are needed to enable two players. 
The "computer" could also be improved for better targeting

SHORTCUTS:
To get started: npm install
To start development and host on localhost:8080 : npm run dev
To build production: npm run build
